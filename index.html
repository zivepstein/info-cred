						<p class="style1">Fake news, conspiracies, manipulated media, selective reporting, facts derided as lies: citizens of
democracies encounter wildly conflicting information about the supposedly factual world. Think
of Pizzagate, a well-known and extensively discredited conspiracy theory about an abuse circle
run by high-ranking Democratic Party officials. Or of the recent 2020 United States presidential
election, where most Republican voters said they believed that Trump won and the official
results were fraudulent. COVID-19 has produced its own myriad of false beliefs, for example
that the virus was engineered in China. Even outright denials of the pandemic or other complex
phenomena such as climate change are not uncommon. The borders between fact and opinion are
blurring, and the prospects of deliberative democracy and collective action become increasingly bleak.</p>
<img width = "50%" style = "display: block; margin-left: 25%;" src="images/post_truth.png" alt="" /><br>
<p>Of course, truth has always been precarious - neither misinformation nor widespread false
beliefs are unique to our time. But the web and social media technologies have distinctly
rearranged the struggles over truth and falsehood. Through its unfiltered publication process, breakneck
pace, and obsession with engagement (rather than accuracy), the modern web has
created not only decentralized modes of expression but also novel vectors for misinformation
and disinformation. We therefore need new tools, concepts and technologies to ensure the
integrity of information ecosystems. This workshop aims to bring together leaders across
industry and academia to discuss what tools for measurement and mitigation could look like. </p>
