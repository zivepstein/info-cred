						<p class="style1">In the 2020 United States presidential election, many Republican voters falsely believed that Donald Trump had won the election. Despite a lack of any meaningful evidence of selection fraud, most Trump voters thought that voting in the United States, and mail-in voting, in particular, was unreliable. Republican voters who were more politically informed were more likely to hold beliefs that contradicted the best available evidence.
As this state of affairs dampens the prospects of a functioning deliberative democracy, researchers have tried to understand the nature and origins of false beliefs and how to reduce their prevalence. </p>

	<p class="style1"> Social media may have played a central role in offering a platform where false news seems to spread further and faster than the truth. Social media has created not only decentralized modes of agency and expression  but also new vectors for mis- and disinformation through its unfiltered publication process. Social media’s novel affordances suggest that new tools, concepts and technologies may be necessary to ensure the integrity of information ecosystems.
This workshop aims to bring together leaders across industry and academia to discuss pathways for diagnosis.</p>
